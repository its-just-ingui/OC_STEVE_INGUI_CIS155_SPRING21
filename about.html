            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This website was created as my capstone project for a web development course
                at Olympic College. It's goal is to showcase the knowledge I've gained throughout the quarter,
                while also having some fun with the topic and such. As I am a beginner, expect to see a lot of changes 
                and edits to the site as time goes on. This is only the first version of the site afterall.
                Thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope you enjoy the site!
            </p>
            <h2>What's New?</h2>
            <p>
                Since this is the first iteration of the site, I'll go over what's made so far.
                I have started developing the Home page, the About page, and the stylesheet that affects the 
                entire site. All other pages are not available yet.
